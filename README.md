# simca
Simple SIM Card T=0 Communication Analyzer

I wrote this code a long time ago. Might be useful for someone...

(Unfortunately I can not share any SIM-ME communication traces as it would take too much work to censor them)

Programs:

 - `simca` -- analyzes on-the-wire T=0 communication

 - `mirror` -- flips DIRECT/INDIRECT convention
